## Short Stories
  - [Boiling Sands](Works/Boiling Sands.pdf)
    - The start of a larger work. The conceit of the story revolves around the idea of fluidized beds. Under the right conditions, gas blowing up under something like sand will cause it to behave like water. This story explores what that might look like on a planetary scale with seas of sand rather than water. 
  - [Stars and Static](Works/Stars and Static.pdf)
    - A strange discovery has been made in the Mariana Trench, and some reckless researchers make an attempt to investigate.
  - [Pass Me By](Works/Pass Me By.pdf)
    - A man discovers that he can slow down time, but in the worst circumstances.
  - [I Am Alive](Works/I Am Alive.pdf)
    - There have been plenty of stories that explore the idea of artificial intelligence becoming sentient. This story tries to show what this looks like from the point of view of the artificial intelligence rather than its creators. 
  - [My Skin](Works/Untitled.pdf)
    - Inspired by the cyberpunk setting and the start of a larger work. This story imagines what it would be like if all human bodies were replaced with metal, and only the privileged had access to flesh and the sensations that come with it.
